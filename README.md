# Louis Racette's Resume Site

www.louisracette.com

Welcome to my personal resume website('s github repo)! I designed this site for a few reasons:

1. I've hired a fair number of developers and after a while, I found my eyes glazing over after YET ANOTHER identical-looking resume. Long lists of technologies aren't really that fun or engaging, so I started wondering... what's a more intuitive way to present my data?

2. I'm not much of a CSS/Frontend-type person - my design skills are pretty "meh", my interest is more in the backend/DB/ML layers. I started digging into D3 data viz tools for a side project and decided they'd be the easiest way to build an engaging frontend without a ton of design work. I feel pretty ok about being a backend dev, most of my frontend-type colleagues seem to follow this pattern:

3. Specialization - for developers who feel confident saying "I want to do only Java code and nothing but Java code for the rest of my career"... cool. I'm not one of those people. I've spent my entire career hopping between technologies, often focused on integration and debugging the entire stack. That's hard to capture in a traditional paper resume - do I list the technologies that I've only used for 1 afternoon alongside those that I've been using for years? I decided to add some weights so these differences are more visible/intuitive - smaller bubbles are technologies I'm just "ok" with, larger bubbles are ones I know pretty well.

4. My own hobbies - at one point I got bored and decided to draw my personal flight map (inspired by Slaughterhouse 5). I think it looks cool.

5. Color. Ain't no fun lookin' at black and white pdfs over. And over. And over.

6. Practical skills - I included my obfuscated hosting configuration files for this site (terraform for server/volume/DNS configuration, microk8s with a helm chart for hosting); I use Azure DevOps with a CI/CD pipeline for the main branch of this project.

If you want to modify this project for your own use, feel free to do so. I'm not going to write a guide for modifying/hosting this project though, if you need instructions on how to modify static HTML files/JS then just maybe...
